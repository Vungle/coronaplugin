			The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
		out.dir
			The name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

		For other overridable properties, look at the beginning of the rules
		files in the SDK, at tools/ant/build.xml

		Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
		be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

		application and should be checked into Version Control Systems.

		To customize existing targets, there are two options:
		- Customize only one target:
			- copy/paste the target into this file, *before* the

			- customize it to your needs.
		- Customize the whole content of build.xml
			- copy/paste the content of the rules files (minus the top node)
			  into this file, replacing the <import> task.
			- customize to your needs.
